My research interest is on Geophysical inverse problem where I utilize data assimilation and time revere imaging method. I applied the data assimilation method in numerical weather prediction to find optimal locations for adaptive observations for reducing forecast error. I also use this method with ship-borne GPS data to examine the possiblity of using ship data in tsunami forecasting. To reconstruct the source related to undersea earthquake, I applied time reverse imaging method.
