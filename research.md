In my research, I am trying to answer two fundamental questions: 1) how can we reduce forecast error significantly and 2) how can we reconstruct initial conditions more quickly and accurately? Thus, I am keen to develop new algorithms based on data assimilation with artificial intelligence. I have implemented the data assimilation method in numerical weather prediction to find optimal locations for adaptive observations for reducing forecast error.  During my PhD, I developed three different source inversion techniques to estimate initial tsunami source in order to understand source mechanism of large tsunami triggered by megathrust and tsunami earthquake as well as submarine landslide. I developed the first time reverse imaging that has potential to be used in tsunami forecasting at far-field. At Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Japan, I introduced an adjoint sensitivity (AS) method to identify the optimal set of stations that improves the performance of the source inversion method. The AS method has the ability to identify erroneous tide gauges that degrade the inversion result. Recently, I have successfully applied data assimilation method with ship-borne GPS data to examine the possibility of using the ship data in tsunami forecasting in the Cascadia subduction zone. 


<!--My research has to date focused on two broad sets of question. The first and most active part of my research agenda focuses on the effect of external threat, especially to the territorial integrity of the state, on the political attitudes of citizens. Here, I have a keen interest in what happens to citizen attitudes toward the government and what type of authority the government should have. The second part of my research agenda is rooted in the peace science approach to the study of international conflict. Here, my research has explored either the conditions of militarized interstate dispute (MID) onset and escalation or how we should understand code these events. In addition, I have also published various items on political topics of interest to me in light of current events. I offer [a three-page research statement](/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf) that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains some more information about works in progress and where some of these works in progress are in the peer review process.

I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.
