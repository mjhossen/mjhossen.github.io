My research focuses on two different fields: numerical weather prediction and geophysical science. In numerical weather prediction, I am keen to develop new algorithm by integrating data assimilation with artificial intelligence, specially deep neural network in order to reduce forecast error. In geophysical science, I focuses on tsunami triggered by undersea earthquake and submarrine landslide. I developed several tsunami source inversion techniques; one of them is based on time reverse imaging method that has widely been used in medical science, geology, seismology etc. An adjoint sensitivity method has also been developed to find optimal stations that improved the inversion result significantly. Currently, I apply data assimilation method with ship-borne GPS data to examine the possibilty of ship data in tsunami forecasting.


<!--My research has to date focused on two broad sets of question. The first and most active part of my research agenda focuses on the effect of external threat, especially to the territorial integrity of the state, on the political attitudes of citizens. Here, I have a keen interest in what happens to citizen attitudes toward the government and what type of authority the government should have. The second part of my research agenda is rooted in the peace science approach to the study of international conflict. Here, my research has explored either the conditions of militarized interstate dispute (MID) onset and escalation or how we should understand code these events. In addition, I have also published various items on political topics of interest to me in light of current events. I offer [a three-page research statement](/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf) that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains some more information about works in progress and where some of these works in progress are in the peer review process.

I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.
