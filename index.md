### About me

I am a postdoctoral research associate at CIRES (Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences), University of Colorado Boulder, USA. My research interests lie primarily in the area of geophysical sciences, applied mathematics and computational science. I am particularly interested in numerical weather prediction and tsunami science to understand natural hazards and to improve the knowledge of their dynamics. I have applied data assimilation method in both numerical weather prediction and tsunami forecasting. Currently, I am developing a methodology using an adjoint sensitivity method with Greenâ€™s function based Time Reverse Imaging to identify the optimal sites for deploying new sea-floor sensors in the Cascadia subduction zone offshore Washington and Oregon. In future, I am keen to develop new algorithms by integrating data assimilation with artificial intelligence, especially deep neural network in order to reduce forecast error in both the fields.
