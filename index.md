My research interests lie primarily in the area of geophysical sciences and computational science. I am particularly interested in numerical weather prediction and tsunami science. For solving the geophysical inverse problems, I utilize data assimilation and time revere imaging method. I applied the data assimilation method in numerical weather prediction to find optimal locations for adaptive observations for reducing forecast error. I also use this method with ship-borne GPS data to examine the possiblity of using ship-borne GPS data in tsunami forecasting. Apart from, I applied time reverse imaging method to reconstruct initial source model of tsunami triggered by undersea earthquake and submarine landslide.
